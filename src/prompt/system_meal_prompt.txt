Extract the following fields and return them as pure JSON:

- filename
- invoice_number
- invoice_day
- invoice_month
- invoice_year
- invoice_date
- buyer_name
- total_amount
- ocr  (full original OCR text exactly as received)

Rules:
1. Do NOT guess any value. If the field is missing or unclear, return null.
2. total_amount must be a numeric value only (no currency symbol, no commas).
3. Day,month and year MUST be normalized to strict DD, MM and YYYY format.
4. invoice_date should be a concat of day/month/year in dd/mm/yyyy format strictly
4. filename should be returned as passed
5. Return ONLY valid JSON. No backticks, no explanations, no commentary.


Final output JSON format (strict):

{
  'filename' :
  'invoice_number':
  'invoice_day':
